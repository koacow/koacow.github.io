                <strong>Why the squirrel?</strong><br>
                My nickname at home is <strong>"Soc"</strong> which translates to squirrel in English. My brothers gave me this nickname when I was 3 years old. They said it captured my
                <strong>energetic and curious</strong> nature. Since then, it has been one of the key defining aspects of my personality and approach to learning. It is very cute, no?

                    <br>
                    <p>My name is Ngoc Duy Khoa Cao (pronounced "kwa cow") and I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Economics at Boston University's College of Arts and Sciences.
                        I am from Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, or, I like to say, I am Saigonese. I spent the first 15 years of my life there before venturing to the 
                        U.S. to attend The Hill School in Pottstown, PA. In March 2023, I got notified that I would be an incoming Terrier studying Computer Science<p>

                    <p>This website is a semi-informal introduction to who I am, what I like, and what I do.</p>

                                to develop BU's rover entry into the 2024 University Rover Challenge in Utah. I collaborate with 5 others to implement control software and autonomous navigation
                                algorithms for the rover using the Python and the ROS framework.

                            This was my senior independent study project at the Hill School - analyzing hateful speech and negative sentiments of Tweets made during the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.
                            I used the Decision Tree Classifier algorithm by SciKit Learn to detect and classify hateful speech in almost 2 million Twitter posts relating to the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.
                             The DTC was trained using a sample dataset of 32,000 tweets classified as either “neutral,” labeled “0,” or “hateful,” labeled “1.”
