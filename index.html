                <p>Hi there! I'm Khoa</p>
                <p>My name is Ngoc Duy Khoa Cao (or Khoa Cao for short) and I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Economics at Boston University.
                    I call Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam, more affectionately known as Saigon, my home. I spent the first 15 years of my life there before venturing to the 
                    U.S. to attend The Hill School. I have presented everything (that is interesting) there is to know about me on this website.<p>
                <p>Feel free to peruse and connect with me <a href="contacts.html">here!</a></p>

                <h1>What I do</h1>
                <p>Here are some clubs/organizations that I was/am involved in.</p>
                <h2>BU Mars Rover</h2>
                <p>
                    I serve as an <em>Autonomous Navigation Engineer</em> for BU Mars Rover's Software team. I'm incredibly blessed to be working with 100+ other members
                    to develop BU's rover entry into the 2024 University Rover Challenge in Utah. I collaborate with 5 others to implement control software and autonomous navigation
                    algorithms for the rover using the ROS and OpenCV object detection library.
                </p>
                <h2>Hack4Impact BU</h2>
                <p>
                    I attend weekly workshops on full-stack web development to prepare myself to join the Junior Development team which creates web applications for local
                    Boston non profits.
                </p>
                <h2>BU Alpha</h2>
                <p>
                    I attend weekly workshops on quantitative finance and financial modeling tools using Python and its libraries. I will culminate my experience in these workshops
                    by building my own market analysis deep learning model. 
                </p>
                <h2>International Ambassadors @ The Hill School</h2>
                <p>
                    I was the Head International Ambassador for The Hill School for 2 years. I led a team of 15 International Ambassadors serving over 100 international students.
                    I collaborated directly with the program advisor and school administrators to implement new policies and support channels, improving the overall experience of
                    international students, specifically new international students, at The Hill School. I also organized events to celebrate over 20 different cultures and raise 
                    awareness of diversity and inclusion.
