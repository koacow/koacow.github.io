                <h2>Powerlifting</h2>
                <p>I began powerlifting 3 years ago with only a goal to improve my physicality and health.
                    I must admit it has become quite an obsession. Now there is no day that goes by that I do not
                    visit BU Fitrec. Below are some memories I have made along the way.

                <h2>Squash</h2>
                <p>I didn't know that this sport existed before attending The Hill School. However, since every student 
                    had to take up a sport and thanks to my wonderful roommate, Ethan, I tried squash for the first time in 
                    September 2019. Soon, I fell in love and squash became an obsession. My love for the sport propelled me 
                    into the #8 on Varsity during my Junior year.

                <p>I will be quoting my MIT admissions essay here.</p>
                <p>"I love cooking. It has evolved from a means to satisfy my appetite to a passion that has
                    helped me fulfill my curiosity and build long-lasting relationships."</p>
