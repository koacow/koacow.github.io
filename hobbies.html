                            <p>I began powerlifting 3 years ago with only a goal to improve my physicality and health.
                                I must admit it has become quite an obsession. Now there is no day that goes by that I do not
                                visit BU Fitrec. Below are some memories I have made along the way.

                            <h2>Squash</h2>
                            <p>I didn't know that this sport existed before attending The Hill School. However, since every student 
                                had to take up a sport and thanks to my wonderful roommate, Ethan, I tried squash for the first time in 
                                September 2019. Soon, I fell in love and squash became an obsession. My love for the sport propelled me 
                                into the #8 on Varsity during my Junior year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What I love about squash is the fast-paced nature of the sport - I am always on my feet and anticipating my opponent's next move. It also gave me many lifetime friends who I call brothers.

                            <p>
                                My dad and I never thought we would pick up a golf club in our lives let alone play 3 rounds of golf in only 2 days. Nevertheless, it has become a passion (though we are not very skilled at it)
                                and means for us to bond. I also joined the Varsity Golf team at The Hill School during my Sophomore year, of which I was a member for 3 years. Like squash, it has also given me many fond memories
                                and long-lasting friendships.
