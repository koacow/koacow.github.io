                            <h2>Powerlifting</h2>
                            <p>I began powerlifting 3 years ago with only a goal to improve my physicality and health.
                                I must admit it has become quite an obsession. Now there is no day that goes by that I do not
                                visit BU Fitrec. Here are some memories I have made along the way.

                            <h2>Squash</h2>
                            <p>I didn't know that this sport existed before attending The Hill School. However, since every student 
                                had to take up a sport and thanks to my wonderful roommate, Ethan, I tried squash for the first time in 
                                September 2019. Soon, I fell in love and squash became an obsession. My love for the sport propelled me 
                                into the #8 on Varsity during my Junior year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What I love about squash is the fast-paced nature of the sport - I am always on my feet and anticipating my opponent's next move. It also gave me many lifetime friends who I call brothers.

                                My dad and I never thought we would pick up a golf club in our lives let alone play 3 rounds of golf in only 2 days. Nevertheless, it has become a passion (though we are not very skilled at it)
                                and means for us to bond. I also joined the Varsity Golf team at The Hill School during my Sophomore year, of which I was a member for 3 years. Like squash, it has also given me many fond memories
                                and long-lasting friendships.

                            <p>
                                I had never been a fan of self-help books, believing that they were "money-grabbers" intended to force people to
                                buy into some seminar that the author creates. When my brother bought me this book I was suspicious of it. However,
                                I decided to give it a chance. What I got out of it was a completely refreshed outlook on personal motivations and goal-setting.
                                In the book, Duckworth talks about how "talent" is not the determining factor for success, which deeply resonated with me, backed up by decades of research. 
                                It prompted a self-evaluation and realization that I can achieve my highest-level goal through a clear-cut plan, proper priorities, and determination.
                                Along the way, it also didn't fail to be an enjoyable read.

                            <p>
                                Artificial Intelligence to me was both a passion, a form of magic, and a highly far-fetched goal. Walking into the Strand bookstore in NYC, my eyes were captured by this little, tucked away book.
                                It claims to be an "accessible introduction to the artificial technology." I fully believe it has delivered on its promise. In this relatively short read,
                                I was able to comprehend the basics of AI and connect every aspect of the technology with everything I have learned in my CS classes, such as Linear Algebra,
                                Calculus, and Graph Theory. By the end, it has transformed the concept of AI from magic into a (complex) algorithm that builds upon everything I have learned.
                                I has reinforced my passion and curiosity for the topic.
